            <p style="width: 350px;">The current Texas State Capitol is the third building to serve that purpose. The first was a wooden structure that had served as the national capitol of the Texas Republic and continued as the seat of government upon Texas' admission to the Union. The second Texas capitol was built in 1853, on the same site as the present capitol in Austin; it was destroyed by fire in 1881, but plans had already been made to replace it with a new, much larger structure.</p>

                <figcaption>Mount Bonnell</figcaption>
                <p style="width: 350px;">Mount Bonnell is located at 30.3210°N, 97.7736°W (WGS 84 datum). The mount is often described as the highest point in Austin, with the elevation at its peak about 775 feet above mean sea level (AMSL).[5] If Mount Bonnell ever held this distinction, it was only because the city limits did not include the next summit to the north, Mount Barker, which has an elevation of about 840 feet above mean sea level (AMSL).[6] Many other areas now in the city of Austin are also higher than Mount Bonnell, but few publicly accessible spots offer such a sweeping view of the downtown area.</p>

                <figcaption>Hamilton pool</figcaption>
                <p style="width: 350px;">Hamilton Pool Preserve is a natural pool that was created when the dome of an underground river collapsed due to massive erosion thousands of years ago. The pool is located about 23 miles (37 km) west of Austin, Texas off Highway 71. Since the 1960s, Hamilton Pool has been a popular summer swimming spot for Austin visitors and residents. Hamilton Pool Preserve consists of 232 acres (0.94 km2) of protected natural habitat featuring a jade green pool into which a 50-foot (15 m) waterfall flows with water temperatures reaching 50 degrees Fahrenheit.[1]</p>
